The Wall is where everyone checks, hangs and surfs on the 330 days each year that the points aren't breaking. It's the only ridable spot when the surf is under three feet, and it's always bigger than everywhere else. Yep, it's that spot.\r\n\r\nHowever, at The Wall, bigger clearly isn't always better. Often, The Wall is just one solid, closed-out wall. On smaller days, this 2.5-mile stretch of sand is the best-shaped wave around. With the peanut gallery watching your every move from the beach, reputations are made and broken every day here. When the wind's cranking offshore, the locals all hunker down under the \"cement tube,\" basking in the sun and tossing rocks as the show unfolds in sand-sucking barrels. As you can imagine, this isn't the easiest spot to rock up to out of nowhere and expect to surf under the radar.",

A lot of water early at report time but the tide is on the way out which will help rideability.
